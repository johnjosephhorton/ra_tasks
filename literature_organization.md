Organizing a folder of PDF articles 
-----------------------------------

1. Email me from the email address you use for your Dropbox account. 

1. I will add you as a collaborator to a folder filled with PDF files, which will usually be called `literature.` 

1. You will create a plain text bibTeX document in that same folder called `literature.bib`.   

1. For each PDF article, find the bibTeX entry somewhere online, ideally at the actual journal where that article was published. Make a separate plain text file called `not_found.md` where you list the names of any articles you cannot find and where you tried looking.    

1. Each bibTeX entry equires a key. The "key" for each entry should be the name of the PDF.
For example, suppose the name of the article is `horton2010.pdf`.
The corresponding entry in bibTeX sould be: 

	@article{horton2010,
	    author={Horton, JohnJ. and Rand, DavidG. and Zeckhauser, RichardJ.},
		title={The online laboratory: Conducting experiments in a real labor market},
		year={2011},
		journal={Experimental Economics},
		volume={14},
		number={3},
		pages={399-425}
	}
	
1. Create a plain text document called ``keys`` that lists each of the
used keys in alphabetical order, one per line with no extra spaces. 

	
	adams2010
	babcock1988
	charles2014
	zylland2010
	

1. Email me when you are done.
