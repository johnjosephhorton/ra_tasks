Convert LaTeX Document to Word Document 
---------------------------------------
1. I will send two files: `example.tex` and `example.pdf` 
1. Create a Google Doc called `example` and share it with me at `john.joseph.horton@gmail.com.`
1. Transfer ownership of the document to me (see: https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2494892?hl=en)
1. Paste the contents of the LaTeX document into Google Doc 
1. Strip out all of the LaTeX formatting commands and
packages. Transform some of the "LaTeX-isms" into MS Word equivalents: 
	- \% to %  
	- \$ to $ 
	- Triple dashfor an em dash into a standard dash
1. Turn LaTeX headings into formatted headings e.g.,
`\section{Introduction}` into `Introduction` with the Heading 1
style. 
1. Re-enter all the equations in the Google Docs equation editor in
the right place they are in the text. Note that you can probably copy
and paste the LaTeX code from `example.tex` into the equation editor. 
1. For tables and images, create a tightly cropped screenshot of the PDF and paste
them into the document as images. 
1. Re-do the footnotes 
1. Re-do all the within-document references e.g., references to
sections, citations, tables etc. using Google Doc bookmarks and headings. 
1. Download the file as a Microsoft Word document to make sure
everything worked---make a note of document aspects that do not work
on MS Word.  
1. Email me when you are done.
