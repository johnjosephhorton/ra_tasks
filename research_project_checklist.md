# Introduction 

Perhaps the biggest mistake an academic can make is to try to answer questions that no one cares about. The purpose of this document is to help prevent that outcome by doing a prospective analysis on likely importance. One could think of it as analogous to the power calculation done before an experiment is run. 

# Motivation/Importance

The purpose of these questions is to force the would-be author to consider whether or not a potential research project is likely to lead to an "important."  
What makes a paper "important" is nebulous, but one workable definition is that it moves the priors of individuals on a question of large practical or theoretical consequence. 

## Tests for "importantance" 

1. Could the paper overturn conventional wisdom on some topic?  
1. Is there some government policy we would change if we knew the answer to the question?
	  1. If we made the change implied by the paper, what would be the effect on social welfare, in *dollars*?
	  1. Would the answer bolster or undermine the policy platform of a major US political party where the two parties are in diagreement? 
1. Do the results have businss implications? 
   1. Would the high-level manger of a firm change how the firm does business if he or she knew the answer to the question?
      1. Would they organize their teams differently? 
      1. Would they change incentive structures or compensation? 
      1. Would they change their invest in people, technology, capital etc.?
      1. Would they pursue a different business model or strategy? 
   1. Could you create a business using the main idea in the paper? Could it be patented? 
   
1. Does it test some important but largely untested theory from economics or a related discipline? 
      1. What theory does it test? 
   	     1. How many citations does the theory paper have? 
		 1. Do any other papers claim to test that same theory? If so, 5Ws, plus citations.  
         1. How can you find theory papers that are in dispute? 
		Do keyword search for phrases that are likely to suggest controversy - examples: 
		"unclear why" 
		"empirical question" 
		"horse race" 
		"theoretically ambiguous" 
		"empirical work is needed" 
 	1. Find papers that are comments on other papers 
1. Does it speak to some noticed social phenomena that are mysterious or for which the CW is likely wrong? 
      1. Try doing a Google search "for why..."
1. Has anyone senior in the discipline identified this as an important question? 
1. Could a laymen accurately predict the results? Would they say "so what?"?  
   * Note: We could actually do a survey, say on Google Survey to assess this claim. 
1. How many academics will care about the paper because it matters to their own work? List them.  
1. Why hasn't this paper been written already? 
   1. The data needed to do the analysis didn't exist 
   1. Technological change of some kind of making this question more important 
   1. Theory being tested is new 
   1. No one has thought of it before, even though paper has long been possible (unlikely) 
1. Is this the very best domain to answer the question? 
1. What is the research question and what are the likely answers?  If only one of the answers is publishable, it suggests the paper is just a counter-intuitive result type paper---those should probably be avoided. 
In other words, a precisely estimated zero should be publishable. 

# Fertility 

A great paper should do more than answer a question---it should also allow other great papers to be written. 

1. Where, precisely, would the paper get a citation in the standard grad text in Labor, Public, Experimental etc.? 
   1. Does the paper gainsay anything in those books? Confirm anything that seems tenuous?  
   1. Write the line that cites your paper, in the correct place---does it flow? 
   
1. Does the paper answer an unanswered question? 
   1. Is there anything *surprising* about the results? 
   1. If they are not surprising, is it because they are dubious "common sense"? 

1. List 5 follow-up projects that one could feasibly do once the questions from this project are answered.

1. Identify 3 well-known, recent but not yet published (high profile working papers) that would cite your paper if it were written - where would it cite it and how important would the citation be? 

## Finding Literature Controversies 
- Comments on Papers 
- Concluding Remarks in recent, important papers 
- Asking people 
- Chicago panel of policy issues (minimum wage etc. - find issues w/ consensus or disagreement)  


# General critiques---Can be applied to almost every paper, but still need good answers
1. Who cares? 
1. Wouldn't this would be better answered in X? 
1. What does this tell us that we didn't already learn from Y? 
1. If we generalize from here to X, wouldn't your results go away? 
1. Why is this surprising? Aren't the results obvious? 
1. Couldn't the results also be explained by X? 
1. Why did you use this model instead of the canonical model Z? 
1. Isn't this just a partial equilibrium result? 
1. What about the Lucas critique? 


# Fertility - Is it likely to start a literature? 
1. Does it raise a number of hard-but-open and somewhat tractable research questions? 
1. Could you use the model for other things? 
1. If you had to write a one-line sentence as part of a citation, what would that line be? 
1. Can you make the dataset available and easy to use? 
1. Does it stake out a position somewhat is likely to disagre with ex ante, before seeing the results? 
1. What does it *give* authors of other papers? 
   1. Ideas for research 
   1. A great quote 
   1. Justication for some point
